# Provenance and reuse ledger

This project speaks Oracle's TNS/TTC protocol without any Oracle client, so two
questions have to have written answers: where the protocol knowledge came from,
and what evidence is stored in this repository. A rule that no wire behavior
ships without capture-backed evidence carries the obligation to account for the
evidence itself.

## What is reused, and under what terms

| Source | What is taken | Terms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DuckDB extension template and `extension-ci-tools` | the build system, the loadable-extension scaffolding, and the CI distribution pipeline | MIT |
| DuckDB itself (submodule, pinned `v1.5.6`) | linked as a library; `duckdb_miniz` is compiled from its vendored copy for bounded in-memory wallet ZIP reading | MIT |
| OpenSSL | linked, not vendored: TLS transport and the digest and cipher primitives O5LOGON needs | Apache-2.0 |
| python-oracledb Thin | **reasoning and invariants, not code and not bytes.** It is the upstream of the protocol invariants recorded in comments throughout `src/`: which field, bit or length a client sends, and what breaks otherwise. | Apache-2.0 / UPL |
| go-ora (`github.com/sijms/go-ora`, commit `360b4b7ac9e96cee3e443180f2d6412bcacee62a`) | **reasoning, not code and not bytes.** A second reading of the listener exchange for multi-address connects: where REDIRECT data sits (inline after a UB2 length, or in the next DATA packet), its NUL between address and reconnect data and the 0x02 flag that announces it, the 0x04 flag on a re-CONNECT, and `(ERR=...)` in a REFUSE. Checked against python-oracledb Thin at commit `4a6d3b393232f6c5d66a497b7d137aa427f289d8` (`connect.pyx`, `connection.pyx`, `connect_params.pyx`), which is also where the FAILOVER / LOAD_BALANCE selection rules come from. Where the two differ, the code says which it follows and why. | MIT |

**No Oracle client software is used or distributed.** No OCI, Instant Client,
ODPI-C, ODBC, JDBC, Python runtime, or helper process is linked, loaded, or
shipped. `scripts/check_no_oracle_client.sh` inspects the built extension for
exactly that and fails if it cannot perform the inspection.

A protocol invariant carried over from elsewhere is evidence, not a
specification: anything load-bearing is confirmed against a live 19c or 23ai
database, or against an independent control, before it ships. Where a capture
disagreed with the source it came from, the disagreement is written down —
including the cases where the source was right, since knowing which side was
correct is worth as much as the defect.

## Captured bytes stored in this repository

Every byte sequence below was recorded from a server this project was tested
against. None contains a credential, a verifier, a wallet, a service name, a
host, or a port: the fetch and DML captures carry only test-table values and
Oracle-internal row addresses, and the negotiation template is a client request
sent before authentication.

Hashes are produced by `scripts/capture_inventory.sh`, which parses the byte
literals out of the source and digests them. If a hash below stops matching,
that is a fixture that changed — say why here rather than replacing the number,
because a fixture edited to make a test pass is otherwise indistinguishable from
one that records what a server sent.

The python-oracledb binds carry the buffer size python chose, which is larger than the value; the test that uses them swaps in this client's size and requires every other byte to match. The TTIDTY negotiation template above is unchanged: this client advertises TTC field version 24 by overwriting that one byte of the request at run time, so its recorded hash still describes the capture. The python-oracledb defines above ask for more of a JSON or VECTOR value than this client does (32 MiB and 1 MiB where it asks for 64 KiB); the test that uses them compares those two column records by their fields and everything before them byte for byte.

Live test databases are external and are named here only by the environment
variables that supply them; see [README.md](README.md). Nothing about an
endpoint is recorded in this repository.

## Synthetic fixtures

The multi-address and redirect tests in `test/cpp/protocol_test.cpp` build
their REDIRECT, REFUSE, ACCEPT and DATA packets in the test from the field
layouts named above. They are not captures, carry no bytes from any server or
client, and so are not inventoried with a hash; the tests say so where they
are defined. None of them has been checked against a live RAC or SCAN listener.
